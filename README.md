# User Location Tracking Project for POC

This project aims to track the location of users using a mobile application. The mobile application sends the location data to Parse, and the data is then displayed on a map on a dashboard using an API. The REST APIs for this project are created using PHP.

# Overview

The project consists of the following components:
- Mobile Application: The mobile application is responsible for collecting and sending the location data of users to the backend system.
- Parse: Parse is used as the backend system to store and manage the location data received from the mobile application.
- REST APIs: The REST APIs are developed in PHP to handle the communication between the mobile application, Parse, and the dashboard.
- Dashboard: The dashboard utilizes an API to visualize the location data on a map, providing a user-friendly interface for tracking user locations.

# Technologies Used
- PHP: Used for creating the REST APIs to handle data communication.
- Parse: Utilized as the backend system for storing and managing location data.
- Mobile Application Development: The mobile application is developed in flutter to collect and send user location data.
- Mapping API: Used to visualize the location data on the dashboard.
