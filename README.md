## Getting Started


# Install dependencies
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the root directory of your Node.js project where the package.json file is located.
Run the following command:
```
npm install
```
This command will read the package.json file and install all the dependencies listed in the dependencies and devDependencies sections. After running this command, npm will download and install the specified dependencies into a node_modules directory in your project.


This will automatically open [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000).
